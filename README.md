# Relative variability package

This package is a Python implementation of the [relative variability package](https://github.com/seanchrismurphy/relativeVariability) written in R. The original package was published [here](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/software/relative_variability/) by Mestdagh et al, accompanying [this](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/software/relative_variability/) paper.

Note that some of the functions are not literally translated from R to python but rather implemented in a way that is more pythonic. Some may require less arguments and will infer the removed parameters from the given data rather than requiring them to be passed explicitly. This is done to make the package more user-friendly and to reduce the need for input checking and error handling.
